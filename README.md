# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository provides implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in C. It's designed to help students and developers understand core concepts and prepare for technical interviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into individual C files, each implementing a specific data structure or algorithm:

* `LinkedList.c`: Implementation of a singly linked list.
* `DoubleLinkedList.c`: Implementation of a doubly linked list.
* `Queue.c`: Implementation of a queue using arrays.
* `Stack.c`: Implementation of a stack using arrays.
* `Sort.c`: Implementation of various sorting algorithms.
* `hashing.c`: Implementation of hash tables.

## Features

* Clear and concise implementations of each data structure and algorithm.
* Code is well-commented for easy understanding.
* Designed for educational purposes and interview preparation.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanthoshKappala/DataStructuresandAlgorithms.git
cd DataStructuresandAlgorithms
```

2. **Compile a specific C file**:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o outputname
```

Replace `filename.c` with the desired C file and `outputname` with your preferred output file name.

3. **Run the compiled program**:

```bash
./outputname
```

## Example

To compile and run the linked list implementation:

```bash
gcc LinkedList.c -o linkedlist
./linkedlist
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the linked list operations.
